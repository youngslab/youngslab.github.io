A smoke test is an initial testing process conducted on a software application or system to verify that the critical functionalities work as expected and the software is stable enough for further testing. The smoke test is usually performed after a new build or version of the software has been deployed, to catch any critical defects or issues that could cause the software to fail or malfunction.

The term "smoke test" comes from the electronics industry, where technicians would turn on a new piece of equipment and watch for smoke to come out of it, indicating that something was wrong. In the software industry, the term has a similar meaning, indicating a quick test to verify that the software doesn't "smoke" or fail immediately.

Smoke tests are typically automated and cover only the most critical features of the software. If the smoke test passes, it indicates that the software is stable enough for further testing and development. If the test fails, it indicates that there are critical issues that need to be fixed before further testing can continue.
